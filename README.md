Edit/Add any ideas here:


index.php:

  This is the first page to be seen, so it should be the login page.


  1. Check post to see if a user logged in/signed up
   - signup: create account with database then:
   - login: create session for user and go to step 2
  2. Use PHP to check sessions if logged in
   - if logged in then go to main.php
  3. Display login/Signup prompt 
   - Show UserName and Password field
   - Show two buttons, one for login and one for signup
  4. When the information is sent
   - Use a post method with action "index.php"


More steps if wanted
  5. Validate username/password with JavaScript/PHP
   - Javascript will cut down amount of page loads so..
